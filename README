snapshot-system
---------------

Many people have their Linux filesystem on LVM volumes, keeping only
/boot on a raw partition if the boot loader does not understand LVM.
The snapshot-system script mounts the complete filesystem recursively,
using snapshots for LVM volumes and bind mounts for other devices.  It
was developed (and is most useful) for creating stable backups.

The mounted devices must be defined in /etc/fstab.  The script is smart
enough to ignore /proc, filesystems with the 'noauto' option and swap.

For example, to mount the filesystem on /mnt, excluding the device at
/media/cdrom, and use a snapshot size of 1 GB:

  $ snapshot-system mount -s 1G -e /media/cdrom /mnt
